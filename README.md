# AspirinModel
Objective for this project is to simulate the industrial production of Aspirin by Acylation of Salycilic Acid using python to predict yields at different reaction conditions and feed rates.
The project will focus on developing personal skills relating to simulation and analysis using techniques such as HNMR and FTIR modeled on python.
This project serves the purpose of developing my personal skills and understanding of first year Bsc chemical engineering concepts.

Assumptions made for this project are:
